=== EXAMPLE 1 (Aluminum - from paper) ===
In 1886, a young chemist named Charles Martin Hall
discovered a revolutionary process for producing
what had previously been one of the most precious
metals on Earth. His method, which involved
passing an electrical current through a solution
of alumina dissolved in molten cryolite, would
transform an element once more valuable than gold
into something so commonplace it would eventually
wrap our leftover food. The metal he learned to
produce so cheaply was called

Water covers most of our planet and is vital for
all life. Humans need to drink water every day to
survive and stay healthy. The ocean contains most
of the water on Earth but it is too salty to
drink. Fresh water comes from rivers and lakes
and underground sources. Many people do not have
access to clean drinking water which causes many
health problems in developing countries around
the world. Scientists are working on new ways to
convert salt water into fresh water for drinking

The brain is the most complex organ in the human
body. It controls everything we do from breathing
to thinking to feeling emotions. Scientists still
do not fully understand how the brain works.
Neurons send signals to each other through tiny
gaps called synapses. The brain uses a lot of
energy compared to its small size. Sleep is very
important for brain health because it allows the
brain to clean out waste and form new memories.
Damage to the brain can cause serious problems

Rain falls when water vapor in clouds condenses
into droplets. These droplets grow heavy and fall
to the ground. Rain is essential for plants and
animals to survive. Too much rain can cause
floods. Too little rain leads to drought. The
water cycle moves water from the oceans to the
sky and back again. Different parts of the world
get different amounts of rain each year. Deserts
get very little rain while tropical forests get
rain almost every day of the year for many

Sleep is necessary for good health. During sleep
the body repairs itself and the brain processes
memories. Most adults need about eight hours of
sleep each night. Children need even more sleep
than adults. Not getting enough sleep can cause
problems with thinking and mood. Good sleep
habits include going to bed at the same time
each night. Avoiding screens before bed helps
people fall asleep faster. A dark quiet room is
best for sleeping well and feeling rested in
