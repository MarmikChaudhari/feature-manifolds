They wrote of rights
not as gifts, but as

EXAMPLE 06
In one block you can
smell bread, hear

EXAMPLE 07
To watch closely is
to notice the small
decisions of wind,
insect, leaf, and

Learning lasts when
curiosity is treated
as a habit, not a
mood that arrives
only on lucky days.

EXAMPLE 09

responsible for
both. Convenience
can hide costs by
moving them out of.

EXAMPLE 10
Plans fail, so you

punishment, but as a
way to keep moving
forward.
